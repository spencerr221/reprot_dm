    "## KNN Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The algorithm is based on the principle that similar data points (i.e. data points that are nearby in space) tend to have similar labels (i.e. they tend to belong to the same class). Therefore, the KNN algorithm can be used to predict the label of a new data point by looking at the labels of the data points that are nearby in space.  \n",
    "### How the KNN work\n",
    "- Using KNN to cluster the new example, let's set K=3\n",
    "- Choose 3 neareast neighbors \n",
    "- The example will belong to the cluster which has a higher proportion\n",

    "\n",
    "### Prediction of the weapon types\n",
    "- We encapsulated the prediction by using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm in the function of call_knn().  \n",
    "- In this function, we split the original dataset into X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test at test_size = 0.33 and random_state =15.  \n",
    "- And then, we using the RandomOverSampler function to deal with the imbalaenced dataset, which supports multi-class resampling by sampling each class independently. Supports heterogeneous data as object array containing string and numeric data.\n",
    "- We also used StandardScaler() to help to get standardized distribution, with a zero mean and standard deviation of one (unit variance). It standardizes features by subtracting the mean value from the feature and then dividing the result by feature standard deviation.\n",
    "- After that, we collected all the output accuracy_score and different numebr of neighbors form 1 to 31 in the list named graph.\n",
    "- We selected the Maximum Accuracy of the increasing neighbors of KNN algorithm.\n",

    "## Decision Tree Algorithm\n",
    "Decision Tree Analysis is a general, predictive modelling tool with applications spanning several different areas. In general, decision trees are constructed via an algorithmic approach that identifies ways to split a data set based on various conditions. It is one of the most widely used and practical methods for supervised learning. Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### How decision tree work\n",
    "- Simple \"Rule-based\" classifier\n",
    "    - At each node, move down the tree based on the node's criteria.\n",
    "    - leaf node contains the prediction\n",
    "- Advantage: can create complex conjunction of rules\n",
    "- Disadvantage: easy to overfit by itself\n",
    "\n",
    "![data_7](../data_7.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction of the terrorist group\n",
    "Firstly, we selected the related features of the prediction values, there are \"Year\",\"Region_Name\",\"Country_Name\",\"AttackType_Name\",\"casualities\",\"Targtype_Name\" and \"Weaptype1_Name\" respectively. The value we need to predict is \"Group_name\".  \n",
    "We selected the top 100 terrorist group in the statistics.  \n",
    "Before we fit the model, we pre-process the each columns of the dataset to replace the black space in the string.  \n",
    "After that, we used one-hot to encode the input features. And split the dataset into  X_train, X_test, y_train and y_test with test_size=0.33 and random_state =15.  \n",
